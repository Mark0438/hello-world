# hello-world
OK, a repository, I see.
I actually love coding, you know? It gives me a sense of creating something, like having a baby.
But um...I'm not really confident. It's alright, I am a humble learner.
And It has been pretty long since I actually did some meaningful things and start being responsible for my fucking life.
